**OBSRVR Flow ‚Äì Tranche 1 Update**
*(Deliverable 1 ‚Äì Core Pipeline Engine & Control Plane API | Target Date ‚Üí June 2025)*
Status   : ~60% Complete üü°

---

### Control Plane API

```
gRPC Service : flowctl.ControlPlane
Endpoints    : Register, Heartbeat, GetServiceStatus, ListServices
Proto Schema : ‚úÖ Complete (control_plane.proto)
Status       : API Operational, Pipeline Engine uses mocks
```

---

### ‚úÖ Progress since last update

* **gRPC API Implementation** complete with 4 core endpoints for service management
* **Service Registry** with automatic health monitoring via heartbeat TTL (30s default)
* **Persistent Storage** layer using BoltDB for service state persistence across restarts
* **DAG-based Pipeline Engine** structure complete but using mock components from testfixtures
* **Buffered Channel Architecture** for backpressure handling (configurable buffer sizes)
* **TLS/mTLS Support** for secure component communication

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's not complete

* **Real Component Implementation** - All sources, processors, and sinks are mocks
* **Container Orchestrator** - Returns "not yet implemented" error
* **Schema Registration API** - Endpoints not implemented
* **Production Error Handling** - Multiple TODOs in pipeline execution code
* **Actual Data Processing** - No real Stellar data ingestion or processing

---

### üîç What have we learned?

* Control plane API is solid, but pipeline execution needs real components
* Mock-based development helped validate architecture but now blocks progress
* Need to prioritize real component implementation for MVP

---

### üöÄ What's next?

* Replace mock components with real source/processor/sink implementations
* Implement container orchestrator for Docker-based execution
* Add schema registration endpoints for Protobuf definitions
* Complete error recovery patterns (marked as TODO in code)
