Perfect question! The intelligent build system is both - it's a hybrid architecture:

  Core Answer

  flowctl CLI has basic local build capabilities for development, while the intelligent
  multi-platform build system is a separate service in the component registry for
  production builds.

  Architecture Overview

  Developer Machine (flowctl CLI)          Component Registry (Separate Service)
  ├── Local Builder                       ├── Advanced Build Service
  │   ├── Language detection              │   ├── Multi-language builders
  │   ├── Simple builds                   │   ├── Multi-platform builds
  │   ├── Local testing                   │   ├── Container generation
  │   └── Development mode                │   ├── Artifact signing
  └── Registry communication              └── Build orchestration

  Two Different Build Systems

  1. Local Builder (in flowctl CLI)

  Purpose: Fast development iteration

  # Local development (flowctl handles this)
  cd my-stellar-source/
  flowctl component build           # Simple local build
  flowctl component test            # Run tests locally
  flowctl dev pipeline.yaml         # Development mode

  # What happens:
  # ✓ flowctl detects Go project (basic detection)
  # ✓ Runs: go mod download && go build
  # ✓ Creates local binary for testing
  # ✓ No registry interaction needed

  Characteristics:
  - Built into flowctl CLI
  - Fast and simple
  - Single platform (your machine)
  - Good enough for development
  - Works offline

  2. Remote Build Service (Component Registry)

  Purpose: Production-grade, multi-platform builds

  # Publishing (registry handles this)
  flowctl component publish --namespace stellar

  # What happens:
  # ✓ flowctl validates component locally
  # ✓ Calls registry API to register component
  # ✓ Registry build service takes over:
  #   - Clones repository
  #   - Advanced language detection
  #   - Builds for linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64
  #   - Creates container images
  #   - Signs artifacts
  #   - Stores in registry

  Characteristics:
  - Separate service (not in flowctl)
  - Comprehensive and robust
  - Multi-platform builds
  - Container generation
  - Security scanning and signing
  - Production-ready artifacts

  Developer Workflow

  Development Phase (Local)

  # All handled by flowctl CLI locally
  flowctl component init my-processor --lang go
  flowctl component build                    # Local build
  flowctl component test                     # Local testing
  flowctl dev my-pipeline.yaml              # Local development mode

  Publishing Phase (Remote)

  # Triggers remote build service
  flowctl component publish --namespace myorg

  # flowctl CLI:
  # 1. Validates locally
  # 2. Calls registry API
  # 3. Registry build service takes over
  # 4. Multi-platform artifacts appear in registry

  Usage Phase (Download Pre-built)

  # Download production artifacts built by registry
  flowctl component install stellar/stellar-source@v1.2.3

  # Gets:
  # ✓ Pre-built native binary for your platform
  # ✓ Pre-built container image
  # ✓ Ready to use immediately

  What's Built Into flowctl

  flowctl CLI includes:
  // Simple local builders for development
  type LocalBuilder interface {
      Build(path string) error     // Basic build
      Test(path string) error      // Run tests
      Clean(path string) error     // Clean artifacts
  }

  flowctl CLI does NOT include:
  - Multi-platform cross-compilation
  - Container image building
  - Advanced caching systems
  - Artifact signing
  - Complex dependency resolution

  Registry Build Service

  Separate service that handles:
  - Multi-language detection and building
  - Cross-platform compilation
  - Container image generation
  - Advanced caching and optimization
  - Security scanning and signing
  - Build queuing and scaling

  Key Benefits of This Split

  1. Fast Local Development

  - No complex build infrastructure needed locally
  - Simple builds for immediate testing
  - Works without internet connection

  2. Production-Grade Publishing

  - Registry handles all the complexity
  - Multi-platform builds without developer setup
  - Professional artifacts for production use

  3. Scalability

  - Registry can scale build infrastructure
  - flowctl CLI stays lightweight
  - Best tool for each job

  Example: ttp-processor-demo

  Local Development

  # Clone and work locally
  git clone https://github.com/withObsrvr/ttp-processor-demo
  cd ttp-processor-demo

  # Local builds (flowctl CLI)
  flowctl bundle build                    # Simple local builds
  flowctl dev --bundle . --mode native   # Local development mode
  # ✓ Fast iteration, good for development

  Publishing to Registry

  # Publish bundle (registry service)
  flowctl bundle publish --namespace stellar

  # Registry service:
  # ✓ Detects Go + TypeScript + JavaScript
  # ✓ Builds all components for multiple platforms
  # ✓ Creates container images for each
  # ✓ Signs and stores everything
  # ✓ Ready for global distribution

  Using Published Bundle

  # Anyone can now install and use
  flowctl bundle install stellar/ttp-processing-suite
  flowctl dev --bundle stellar/ttp-processing-suite --mode native
  # ✓ Uses pre-built, optimized artifacts
  # ✓ Works immediately, no build required

  Summary

  The intelligent build system is primarily a separate service in the component registry,
  but flowctl CLI includes basic local build capabilities for development workflow.

  This gives you the best of both worlds:
  - Fast local iteration during development
  - Production-grade artifacts for publishing and distribution
