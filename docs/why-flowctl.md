# Why Use flowctl? Orchestration vs Manual Service Management

This document explores the advantages of using flowctl for orchestrating distributed event processing systems compared to manually managing individual services.

## The Challenge: Managing Distributed Event Processing Systems

Modern event processing architectures often consist of multiple specialized components:
- **Sources**: Ingest data from various origins (databases, APIs, message queues, blockchains)
- **Processors**: Transform, filter, enrich, or analyze event streams
- **Sinks**: Deliver processed data to destinations (databases, APIs, analytics platforms)

While these components can be developed and run independently, orchestrating them into a cohesive system presents significant challenges.

## Case Study: TTP Processor Demo Architecture

Consider the [ttp-processor-demo](https://github.com/withObsrvr/ttp-processor-demo) which processes Stellar blockchain events:

```
stellar-live-source → ttp-processor → consumer_app
```

Each component is a separate service that must be:
- Started in the correct order
- Configured with proper network endpoints
- Monitored for health and performance
- Restarted on failure
- Scaled based on load

## Manual Orchestration: The Traditional Approach

Without flowctl, running these services requires significant manual effort:

### 1. Complex Startup Procedures
```bash
# Start each service manually with environment variables
export STELLAR_RPC_URL="https://soroban-rpc.example.com"
export GRPC_PORT=8080
./stellar-live-source &

export TTP_SOURCE_ADDR=localhost:8080
export GRPC_PORT=8081
./ttp-processor &

export PROCESSOR_ADDR=localhost:8081
export OUTPUT_DIR=/var/data
./consumer_app &
```

### 2. Service Discovery Challenges
- Hardcoded service addresses
- Manual port management
- No dynamic endpoint resolution
- DNS/networking complexity

### 3. Configuration Management Issues
- Scattered configuration across multiple files
- Environment variable proliferation
- Duplicate settings
- No validation or type safety

### 4. Operational Complexity
- Manual health monitoring
- Custom logging aggregation
- No unified metrics
- Complex debugging across services

## flowctl: Declarative Pipeline Orchestration

flowctl transforms this complex orchestration into a simple configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: obsrvr.com/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: ttp-processing-pipeline
spec:
  sources:
    - name: stellar-source
      image: withobsrvr/stellar-live-source:latest
      config:
        rpcUrl: "https://soroban-rpc.example.com"
        dataSource: "rpc"
  
  processors:
    - name: ttp-processor
      image: withobsrvr/ttp-processor:latest
      inputs: ["stellar-source"]
      config:
        filterProtocol: "ttp"
  
  sinks:
    - name: data-consumer
      image: withobsrvr/consumer-app:latest
      inputs: ["ttp-processor"]
      config:
        outputFormat: "json"
```

### Deployment with a Single Command
```bash
flowctl apply -f pipeline.yaml
```

## Embracing Open Source Flexibility

As an open source project, flowctl recognizes that every team has unique requirements. Our philosophy is to **empower, not constrain**:

### 1. **Use What Works for You**

flowctl is designed to complement your existing solutions:
- **Have a great indexer?** Keep it and add orchestration
- **Custom processing logic?** Wrap it as a processor
- **Specific output format?** Build a custom sink

### 2. **Gradual Adoption**

You don't need to rewrite everything:
```yaml
# Start simple - just add orchestration to existing components
sources:
  - name: existing-service
    image: yourteam/current-indexer:v1
sinks:
  - name: existing-output
    image: yourteam/current-writer:v1
    inputs: ["existing-service"]
```

### 3. **Build Your Own Components**

The component interface is simple and open:
```go
// Any service implementing this interface can be a flowctl component
type Source interface {
    Start(ctx context.Context) error
    GetEvents() <-chan Event
}
```

### 4. **Mix and Match**

Combine flowctl-provided components with your own:
- Use flowctl's Stellar source with your custom processor
- Use your custom source with flowctl's database sinks
- Create hybrid pipelines that leverage the best of both

### 5. **Community-Driven Development**

flowctl grows through community contributions:
- Share your components
- Propose new features
- Fork and customize for your needs
- Contribute improvements back

### When to Build Custom vs Use flowctl

**Build Custom When:**
- You have very specific domain logic
- Performance requirements demand specialized optimization
- You need deep integration with proprietary systems

**Use flowctl When:**
- You need orchestration and operational features
- You want to focus on business logic, not infrastructure
- You need flexibility to change and scale
- You want production-ready monitoring and deployment

**Best of Both Worlds:**
- Wrap your custom components with flowctl
- Get orchestration benefits without losing your specialized logic
- Maintain full control while gaining operational advantages

## When to Use flowctl

flowctl is ideal for:
- **Event-driven architectures** with multiple processing stages
- **Data pipelines** requiring transformation and enrichment
- **Blockchain indexing** with complex processing logic
- **Real-time analytics** with multiple data sources
- **Microservices** that process event streams
- **Teams wanting orchestration** without rebuilding existing components

## Conclusion

While individual services like those in the ttp-processor-demo can function independently, flowctl provides the orchestration layer that transforms a collection of services into a production-ready system. It eliminates the complexity of manual orchestration while adding enterprise-grade features for observability, security, and scalability.

The choice is clear: spend time building your business logic, not reinventing orchestration infrastructure. flowctl handles the complexity so you can focus on what matters - processing your data effectively.
